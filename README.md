# Solar_Panel_Optimization
Solar energy is one of the most promising and rapidly growing renewable energy sources worldwide. It is clean, abundant, and sustainable, making it a key player in the global transition toward low-carbon energy systems. Rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems, in particular, offer a practical and scalable solution for meeting residential, commercial, and industrial energy demands.

However, optimal placement of rooftop solar panels is often challenged by complex roof geometries, permanent structures, and shadowed areas. This project addresses these issues by automating rooftop and shadow detection using aerial imagery and deep learning. The result is a smart, optimized solar panel layout tailored to each rooftop.
